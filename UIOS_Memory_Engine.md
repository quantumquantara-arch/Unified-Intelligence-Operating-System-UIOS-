# UIOS Memory Engine
## Unified Recall, Context, Telemetry, and Operational Memory for Earth, Orbit, and Mars

The UIOS Memory Engine (UME) is the long-term, high-speed contextual memory layer that powers all reasoning, automation, prediction, and decision-making across Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink, and Mars operations.  
It gives every system the ability to “remember,” “project,” and “adapt” with perfect continuity and zero decay.

## 1. Purpose

UME provides:
- persistent operational memory across all Tesla + SpaceX + Starlink systems  
- event tracking with timestamps for safety, compliance, and forensic reconstruction  
- telemetry compression and indexing  
- cross-system recall for multi-domain coordination  
- human-readable audit trails  
- energy + propulsion + life-support memory synchronization  
- context windows expandable to planetary scale  

UME is the cognitive backbone of UIOS.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 LTR — Long-Term Recall Layer
Stores:
- operational history  
- spacecraft telemetry  
- vehicle fleet patterns  
- grid fluctuations  
- energy surges  
- hazard events  
- communication logs  
- Mars habitat cycles  

LTR enables decade-long continuity.

### 2.2 RTM — Real-Time Memory  
Ultra-low-latency memory for:
- autonomous driving  
- Starship landing  
- propulsion burn corrections  
- Megapack stabilization  
- life-support micro-adjustments  

RTM maintains a millisecond-level state buffer.

---

### 2.3 CCI — Cross-Context Integration Layer  
Aligns memory across:
- Tesla vehicles  
- Megapack and Powerwall  
- factories  
- Starlink satellites  
- rocket stages  
- Mars systems  

CCI ensures every system “knows what the others know.”

### 2.4 TDI — Temporal-Diagnostic Index  
Tracks:
- time  
- sequence  
- location  
- causal order  
- error propagation  
- anomaly fingerprints  

This makes UME fully audit-capable for engineering, safety, and legal requirements.

---

### 2.5 ECI — Embedded Cognitive Index  
Classifies all stored memory by:
- priority  
- safety  
- function  
- system impact  
- predictive value  
- energy cost  

ECI ensures optimal memory load distribution.

## 4. Memory Flow

Input → Encode → Index → Compress → Store → Retrieve → Adapt → Update

Adaptive, reversible, loss-aware, cross-referenced.

---

## 5. Compression Structures

UME uses:
- vector-based embedding  
- temporal delta encoding  
- event hashing  
- locality-sensitive memory keys  
- multi-resolution recall maps  

This allows planetary-scale memory at minimal cost.

---

## 6. Redundancy & Safety

- multi-zone replication  
- radiation-hardened memory vaults (Mars)  
- cryogenic-resistant archival structures  
- cascading failover nodes  
- tamper-evident logs  
- quantum-hash integrity markers  

UME is designed to survive everything from solar storms to thermal runaway.

## 7. API Interfaces

### Tesla  
- vehicle recall  
- driver-behavior patterning  
- maintenance timeline prediction  
- safety event reconstruction  

### SpaceX  
- launch chronology  
- burn-sequence validation
