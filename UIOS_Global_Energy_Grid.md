# UIOS Global Energy Grid Intelligence

## Overview
The UIOS Global Energy Grid Intelligence Module provides the unified cognitive layer that manages, stabilizes, optimizes, and predicts energy flow across Earth, orbit, and Mars.  
It integrates Tesla Energy systems, Megapacks, solar farms, Powerwalls, Starlink power demands, factory loads, Supercharger networks, SpaceX launch site grids, and future off-world energy infrastructures.

UIOS turns the world’s energy systems into a coherent, adaptive organism capable of maintaining stability across all timescales and all environments.
