# UIOS Self-Healing Systems & Predictive Maintenance Engine

## Overview
The Self-Healing & Predictive Maintenance Engine (SHPME) enables UIOS-powered systems  
(Tesla vehicles, Starship, Optimus, Gigafactories, Starlink, energy grids)  
to detect, predict, and repair faults before failure occurs.

It massively reduces downtime, increases lifespan, and supports planetary-scale operations.

## 1. Real-Time Fault Detection

### 1.1 Sensor Fusion Monitoring
UIOS continuously analyzes:
- thermal signatures  
- vibration patterns  
- torque curves  
- electrical noise  
- pressure & fluid dynamics  
- material strain  
- acoustic fingerprints  
- optical sensor anomalies  

Every component becomes a monitored system.

### 1.2 Behavior Deviation Recognition
Identifies:
- drift from baseline physics  
- abnormal usage patterns  
- stress-cycle irregularities  
- outliers in power draw  
- latency variations  
- software execution anomalies  

Deviation = early warning.

### 3.3 Redundant Path Recovery
If a system pathway fails:
- switches to backup modes  
- isolates failing units  
- preserves operation dynamically
