# UIOS Extraterrestrial Resource Mapping

## Overview
The Extraterrestrial Resource Mapping (ERM) module is UIOS’s deep-space exploration and extraction intelligence.  
It identifies, quantifies, and operationalizes natural resources on:

- the Moon  
- Mars  
- Phobos & Deimos  
- near-Earth asteroids  
- main-belt asteroids  
- icy bodies  
- metallic bodies  
- future interplanetary targets  

ERM enables autonomous mining, fuel production, construction, and long-duration mission sustainability.
