# UIOS Orbital Robotics Intelligence

## Overview
The UIOS Orbital Robotics Intelligence Module is the unified operating layer for all autonomous robotic systems in orbit — including Starlink deployment mechanisms, inspection drones, orbital manipulators, depot servicing robots, microgravity manufacturing systems, and future in-space construction fleets.

UIOS enables orbital robots to think, coordinate, and operate as a coherent multi-agent network across low Earth orbit, lunar orbit, deep-space transit, and Mars orbit.

This is the nervous system for the orbital infrastructure of a multi-planetary civilization.
