# UIOS Multi-Domain Autonomy Framework
A universal autonomy architecture unifying Tesla vehicles, Optimus robots, SpaceX operations, Starlink networks, Gigafactories, and global logistics under one coherent intelligence system.

---

## 1. Purpose

To define a single autonomy layer that can:
- drive vehicles
- fly drones
- coordinate robot fleets
- route satellites
- optimize manufacturing
- manage energy grids
- support space missions
- adapt across all environments (land, sea, air, orbit)

UIOS turns every Tesla/SpaceX asset into part of one coordinated super-system.

## 2. Core Design Principles

### 2.1 Domain-General Intelligence
Shared neural models for:
- perception  
- planning  
- navigation  
- risk detection  
- prediction  
- resource allocation  
- task execution  

The same core architecture runs across land vehicles, robots, spacecraft, and factories.

### 2.2 Local Autonomy + Global Coordination
Each device runs:
- local autonomy (onboard inference)
- fleet-level coordination (cloud or interlink)
- planetary-level optimization (UIOS control tower)

### 2.3 Cross-Domain Adaptability
One model family adapts to:
- driving  
- walking  
- grasping  
- flying  
- orbital routing  
- factory pick/pack operations  
- grid balancing  
- hazard response

## 3. Modular Intelligence Stack

### 3.1 Perception Layer
Unified perception across all sensors:
- camera  
- radar  
- lidar  
- satellite imaging  
- thermal  
- accelerometers  
- factory sensors  
- robotic haptics  

All perception maps are normalized into a shared spatial-temporal model.

### 3.2 Prediction Layer
Predicts:
- object motion  
- traffic flow  
- energy load  
- supply chain timelines  
- orbital drift  
- robot fatigue  
- component failure  

### 3.3 Decision Layer
A generalized planning model that generates:
- vehicle maneuvers  
- robot task sequences  
- spacecraft burn windows  
- manufacturing optimization  
- grid stabilization actions  

### 3.4 Action Layer
Executes tasks across:
- vehicles  
- robots  
- actuators  
- factory machines  
- satellites  
- energy hardware  
- launch infrastructure
