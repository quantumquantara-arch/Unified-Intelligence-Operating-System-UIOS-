# UIOS Space Weather Intelligence

## Overview
Space Weather Intelligence (SWI) is UIOS’s real-time solar, cosmic, and geomagnetic prediction engine.  
It protects everything Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink rely on:

- satellites  
- Starship missions  
- launch windows  
- ground stations  
- global energy networks  
- Optimus and robotics electronics  
- vehicle autonomy sensors  
- planetary communications  

SWI forms the shield and early-warning layer that keeps the entire civilization-scale network stable.
