# UIOS Energy Intelligence
## Unified Energy Prediction, Optimization, Storage, and Distribution for Earth, Orbit, and Mars

UIOS Energy Intelligence creates a single energy-optimization layer that supports all Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink, and Mars infrastructure.  
It unifies forecasting, grid balancing, battery health, propulsion, and life-support power management into one coherent system.

## 1. Purpose

UIOS-EI is designed to:
- predict energy demand across billions of devices  
- stabilize microgrids and megagrids simultaneously  
- optimize consumption in real time  
- coordinate charging, storage, solar, and mechanical energy flow  
- integrate Tesla vehicles, Powerwall, Megapack, Starlink, and Mars habitats  
- reduce waste by >30% and increase stability to 99.999%  

It serves as the universal energy brain across Earth and Mars.
