## 1. Purpose

To define how Optimus integrates into Tesla’s full industrial stack as:
- an autonomous worker  
- a precision assembler  
- a fleet-coordinated logistic unit  
- a maintenance technician  
- an inspection and safety agent  
- an adaptive factory intelligence node  

Optimus becomes the robotic backbone of Tesla’s global production engine.
